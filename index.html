                    <h2>Bhagavad-gītā is also known as Gītopaniṣad. It is the essence of Vedic knowledge and one of the
                        most important Upaniṣads in Vedic literature. Of course there are many commentaries in English
                        on the Bhagavad-gītā, and one may question the necessity for another one. This present edition
                        can be explained in the following way. Recently an American lady asked me to recommend an
                        English translation of Bhagavad-gītā. Of course in America there are so many editions of
                        Bhagavad-gītā available in English, but as far as I have seen, not only in America but also in
                        India, none of them can be strictly said to be authoritative because in almost every one of them
                        the commentator has expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gītā as
                        it is.</h2>

                    <h2>Out of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are actually inquiring about
                        their position, as to what they are, why they are put into this awkward position and so on.
                        Unless one is awakened to this position of questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he
                        doesn’t want suffering but rather wants to make a solution to all suffering, then one is not to
                        be considered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is awakened in
                        one’s mind. In the Brahma-sūtra this inquiry is called brahma-jijñāsā. Athāto brahma-jijñāsā.
                        Every activity of the human being is to be considered a failure unless he inquires about the
                        nature of the Absolute. Therefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where
                        they came from and where they shall go after death are proper students for understanding
                        Bhagavad-gītā. The sincere student should also have a firm respect for the Supreme Personality
                        of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.</h2>

        <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder text-decoration-underline mb-3 col-12">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BHAGAVAD-GITA</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <p class="fw-bold fs-4">Bhagavad-gita, a philosophical poem comprising seven hundred Sanskrit verses, is
                    one of the most
                    important philosophical and literary works known to man. More commentaries have been written upon
                    the Gita than upon any other philosophical or religious text in history. As a classic of timeless
                    wisdom, it is the main literary support for the oldest surviving spiritual culture in the world-that
                    of India’s Vedic civilization. Not only has the Gita directed the religious life of many centuries
                    of Hindus, but, owing to the pervasive influence of religious concepts in Vedic civilization, the
                    Gita has shaped India’s social, ethical, cultural and even political life as well. Attesting to
                    India’s nearly universal acceptance of the Gita, practically every sectarian cult and school of
                    Hindu thought, representing a vast spectrum of religious and philosophical views, accepts
                    Bhagavad-gita as the summum bonum guide to spiritual truth. The Gita, therefore, more than any other
                    single historical source, provides penetrating insight into the metaphysical and psychological
                    foundation of India’s Vedic culture, both ancient and contemporary.
                    <br>
                    The influence of Bhagavad-gita, however, is not limited to India. The Gita has deeply affected the
                    thinking of generations of philosophers, theologians, educators, scientists and authors in the West
                    as well Henry David Thoreau reveals in his journal, “Every morning I bathe my intellect in the
                    stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagavad-gita … in comparison with which our modern
                    civilization and literature seem puny and trivial.”
                    <br>
                    The Gita has long been considered the essence of Vedic literature, the vast body of ancient
                    scriptural writings that forms the basis of Vedic philosophy and spirituality. As the essence of the
                    108 Upanisads, it is sometimes referred to as Gitopanisad.
                    <br>
                    Although widely published and read by itself, Bhagavad-gita originally appears as an episode of the
                    Mahabharata, a great historical epic, in which it occupies chapters 25 through 42 in the Bhisma
                    Parva. Authorship of the Mahabharata is traditionally attributed to the great sage Vedavyasa (Srila
                    Vyasadeva). It was Vyasa, “the literary incarnation of God,” who, according to orthodox Vedic
                    historiography, put the eternal Vedic wisdom into writing at the onset of the Kali-yuga, the current
                    age of spiritual darkness. After compiling the four principal Vedas, the Upanisads and the
                    Vedanta-sutra, he decided to compile the Puranas and the Mahabharata for the benefit of the common
                    people who could not sufficiently assimilate the lofty philosophical teachings of the earlier works.
                    By exposure to the philosophical conclusions of the Vedas through the medium of ostensibly
                    historical narrations, the common man would more readily understand and benefit from Vedic truth.
                    <br>
                    Thus, Bhagavad-gita, the essence of Vedic wisdom, was injected into the Mahabharata, an
                    action-packed narrative of an important era in ancient Indian politics.
                    <br>
                    Bhagavad-gita comes to us in the form of a battlefield dialogue between Lord Sri Krishna and the
                    warrior Arjuna. The dialogue occurs just before the onset of the first military engagement of the
                    Kuruksetra War, a great fratricidal war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas to determine India’s
                    political destiny. Arjuna, forgetful of his prescribed duty as a ksatriya (warrior) whose duty is to
                    fight for a righteous cause in a holy war, decides, for personally motivated reasons, not to fight.
                    Krishna, who has agreed to act as the driver of Arjuna’s chariot, sees His friend and devotee in
                    illusion and perplexity and proceeds to enlighten Arjuna regarding his immediate social duty
                    (varna-dharma) as a warrior and, more important, his eternal duty or nature (sanatana-dharma) as an
                    eternal spiritual entity in relationship with God. Thus the relevance and universality of Krishna’s
                    teachings transcend the immediate historical setting of Arjuna’s battlefield dilemma. Krishna speaks
                    for the benefit of all souls who have forgotten their eternal nature, the ultimate goal of
                    existence, and their eternal relationship with Him.
